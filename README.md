# WEATHER DATA CORRESPONDING TO CITY

# When a city is passed in the body, the corresponding current weather, latitude and longitude
# are returned in the response. The format in which the response is returned is dictated by the
# `output_format` flag, the options for this flag are “json” or “xml”. 

# If the output flag is set to json the response from the API should be in json format and if the flag is
# set to xml the response should be in xml format.
